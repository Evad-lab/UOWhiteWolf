The Kokiri go into Haven

The Deku go outside of Yew(HeartWood)

Place the Boomerange on a spawner(perferably set so that there is a long time between spawns) in any building in Zento in Tokuno

Place the Great Fairt in the Mushroom Cave in Ilsh

Spawn Agahnim in the Desert South of Umbra, set it with a long range so that he doesnt spawn in the same place and the players have to search the desert.
